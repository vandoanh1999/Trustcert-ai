## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### ðŸš€ Major Release - ASA-Fusion v2.0

This is a breakthrough release introducing a completely new modular SMT solving framework.

### Added

#### Core Architecture
- **Plugin Architecture**: Dynamic decision procedure loading with standard interfaces
- **DecisionProcedure Interface**: Standard interface for all solvers with `can_handle`, `decide`, and `explain` methods
- **ProcedureRegistry**: Central registry for managing and discovering decision procedures
- **SolverResult**: Standardized result format with metadata

#### Decision Procedures
- **PresburgerProcedure**: Linear integer arithmetic solver (addition, subtraction, comparisons)
- **DiophantineProcedure**: Integer polynomial equation solver with GCD-based solvability check
- **Z3Solver**: Integration with Microsoft Z3 SMT solver for general problems

#### AI Reasoning Layer
- **ProblemAnalyzer**: Automatic problem type detection and classification
- **Confidence Scoring**: Confidence estimation for problem type classification
- **Complexity Analysis**: 1-10 complexity scoring for problems
- **Strategy Recommendation**: Intelligent solver recommendation based on problem analysis
- **Optimization Hints**: Suggestions for problem transformation and simplification

#### Security Features
- **InputValidator**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
  - Dangerous pattern detection (eval, exec, import, file operations)
  - Size limits to prevent DoS attacks
  - Nesting depth validation
  - Character sanitization and null byte protection
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Resource-limited execution environment
  - Timeout enforcement using signals
  - Memory limits via resource module
  - CPU time limits
  - Isolated execution
- **Security Documentation**: SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting guidelines

#### Documentation
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive technical architecture documentation
- **LICENSING_INFO.md**: Detailed licensing and commercial information
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policy and vulnerability reporting
- **Interactive Demo**: examples/asa_fusion_demo.py showcasing all features
- **README Updates**: Usage examples, feature descriptions, and licensing info

#### Testing
- **25 New Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for all ASA-Fusion components
  - InputValidator tests (5 tests)
  - ProblemAnalyzer tests (4 tests)
  - PresburgerProcedure tests (3 tests)
  - DiophantineProcedure tests (3 tests)
  - ASAFusionEngine tests (6 tests)
  - ProcedureRegistry tests (3 tests)
- **27 Total Tests**: All tests passing

#### Licensing & Protection
- **Proprietary License**: Clear licensing terms in LICENSE file
- **Copyright Headers**: All source files protected with copyright notices
- **Anti-Theft Measures**: Multiple layers of IP protection
- **Commercial Licensing**: Framework for commercial use and premium features

### Changed
- **Version Bump**: 1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0
- **License**: MIT â†’ Proprietary
- **README**: Complete overhaul with new features and structure
- **Project Structure**: Organized into modular architecture

### Technical Details

#### Module Structure
```
apps/asa_fusion/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/          # Base interfaces and registry
â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/       # Built-in decision procedures
â”œâ”€â”€ solvers/       # External solver integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ ai_layer/      # AI reasoning and analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ security/      # Validation and sandboxing
â””â”€â”€ engine.py      # Main orchestration engine
```

#### Dependencies
- Optional Z3 solver support (z3-solver package)
- No new required dependencies

#### Performance
- Execution times: < 1ms for simple problems
- Priority-based solver selection
- Early rejection for incapable procedures
- Configurable timeouts (default 5000ms)

### Security
- All inputs validated by default
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Resource limits enforced
- Dangerous pattern detection
- No remote code execution vulnerabilities

### Known Limitations
- Some decision procedures are simplified demonstrations
- Z3 integration requires SMT-LIB2 parser (not fully implemented)
- Sandboxing uses Linux-specific features (signal-based)
- Single-threaded execution (parallelization planned for future)
