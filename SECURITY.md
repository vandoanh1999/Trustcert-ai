## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

ASA-Fusion v2.0 includes comprehensive security features:

### Input Validation
- Pattern-based dangerous code detection
- Size limits to prevent DoS
- Nesting depth validation
- Character sanitization
- Null byte protection

### Sandboxed Execution
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Timeout enforcement
- Isolated execution environment
- No file system access (except configured)
- No network access (configurable)

### Protection Against Common Attacks
- **Code Injection:** Blocks eval(), exec(), __import__()
- **Path Traversal:** Validates file paths
- **XSS:** Input sanitization
- **DoS:** Rate limiting, timeouts, resource limits
- **Memory Exhaustion:** Memory limits in sandbox

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in ASA-Fusion or TrustCert AI, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO:**
- Email security reports to: phamvandoanh9@gmail.com
- Use subject line: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
- Include detailed steps to reproduce
- Wait for confirmation before public disclosure

**DO NOT:**
- Open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Share vulnerabilities publicly before a fix is available
- Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in production systems

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:
1. **Vulnerability Type:** (e.g., Code Injection, DoS, etc.)
2. **Affected Components:** Which modules are affected
3. **Attack Scenario:** How could this be exploited?
4. **Impact Assessment:** What could an attacker achieve?
5. **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed instructions
6. **Proof of Concept:** Code or screenshots (if applicable)
7. **Suggested Fix:** If you have ideas for mitigation

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Acknowledgment | 24 hours | Confirm receipt of report |
| Initial Assessment | 72 hours | Severity classification |
| Investigation | 1-2 weeks | Root cause analysis |
| Fix Development | 2-4 weeks | Patch development |
| Disclosure | After fix | Coordinated disclosure |

### Severity Classification

**Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Data breach of sensitive information
- Response: Immediate action, emergency patch

**High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- Significant data exposure
- Response: Priority fix, patch within 2 weeks

**Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**
- Cross-site scripting
- Information disclosure
- DoS conditions
- Response: Standard timeline, patch in next release

**Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**
- Minor information leaks
- Configuration issues
- Response: Fix in future release

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers Integrating ASA-Fusion

1. **Always Enable Validation**
   ```python
   engine = ASAFusionEngine(enable_validation=True)
   result = engine.solve(problem, validate=True)
   ```

2. **Use Sandboxing in Production**
   ```python
   engine = ASAFusionEngine(enable_sandbox=True)
   ```

3. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**
   ```python
   result = engine.solve(problem, timeout_ms=5000)
   ```

4. **Validate User Input**
   - Never trust input from untrusted sources
   - Implement additional validation layers
   - Use API rate limiting

5. **Keep Updated**
   - Subscribe to security announcements
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Monitor for new versions

### For Production Deployments

1. **Network Security**
   - Run behind a firewall
   - Use HTTPS only
   - Implement API authentication

2. **Resource Limits**
   - Set CPU limits in container/VM
   - Configure memory limits
   - Implement request rate limiting

3. **Monitoring**
   - Log all security events
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns
   - Set up alerts for anomalies

4. **Access Control**
   - Use API keys for authentication
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Audit access logs regularly

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Simplified Implementations**
   - Some decision procedures are demonstrations
   - Not all edge cases are handled
   - Use Z3 fallback for critical applications

2. **Sandboxing**
   - Linux-specific resource limits (signal-based)
   - May not work on all platforms
   - Test in your environment before production

3. **Z3 Integration**
   - Requires z3-solver package for full functionality
   - Z3 has its own security considerations
   - Review Z3's security documentation

### Recommendations

- **Production Use:** Wait for v2.1 with enhanced security
- **Critical Applications:** Conduct security audit
- **Enterprise:** Consider commercial license with security support
